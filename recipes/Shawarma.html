        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Shawarma</strong>, is <strong><em>also</em></strong> a Popular Dish many around the world <em>love</em></p>

        <p>Shawarma, popular street food in the Middle East, which originated in Turkey and is made of spit-roasted layers of lamb, beef, 
            or other meat that are sliced and often wrapped in or served with pita. Shawarma is similar to Greek gyros, though the former is seasoned with more spices and the latter with more herbs.</p>

        <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Spices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How To Make Shawarma Step-By-Step</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the shawarma spice mixture. Simply add the spices into a small bowl and mix to combine.</li>
            <li> Cut up some boneless, skinless chicken thighs into small bite-size pieces (you can use chicken breast if you like, this is just my personal preference.)</li>
            <li>Spice the chicken up, make sure to coat the chicken well with the spice mixture. Add onions, lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. If you have the time, cover and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight (if you don't, you can skip the marinating time, it'll still be delicious)</li>
            <li>When ready, lay the chicken shawarma on a large sheet pan and bake in 425 degrees heated oven for 30 minutes or so (you can check a bit earlier as ovens do vary.)</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
