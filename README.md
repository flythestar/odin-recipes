---------- Project: Recipes ----------

Project Recipes is a Project in 'The Odin Project' Which I Have to Complete.

----- THE GOAL -----
Create a Basic Recipe Website which has an index page where you will Recipe Cards which consist of a Picture and a Name of The Recipe. Once you click on The Recipe Card it'll open another page which'll have The Full Recipe Ingrediants, and Directions on How To Make it.
